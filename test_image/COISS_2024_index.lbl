  DESCRIPTION           = "This version of the Cassini ISS image index for
volumes starting with COISS_2001 has been edited by the PDS Ring-Moon Systems
Node for compliance with PDS3 standards. Invalid rows have been edited so they
obey the specified DATA_TYPE and can therefore be read more easily by
software. For example, where a numeric column contained 'NULL', that value has
been replaced by '-1.e32' and, in the label, a numeric value of -1.e32 has
been identified as the NULL_CONSTANT or NOT_APPLICABLE_CONSTANT.

Note that NULL_CONSTANT identifies values that could be known but are not,
whereas NOT_APPLICABLE_CONSTANT refers to values that are undefined. An
example of the former would be a missing value of SC_SUN_POSITION_VECTOR; an
example of the latter would be a value of LOWER_LEFT_LATITUDE in an image
where the lower left corner does not intercept the target body."
