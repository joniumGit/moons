  DESCRIPTION                   = "This index describes the ring intercept
    geometry of the field of view of Cassini ISS images. The table contains
    one row for each image file found on the volume identified by the
    VOLUME_ID keyword above.

    Occasionally, SPICE pointing information is unavailable for the time at
    which an image was exposed. When this situation occurs, no row has been
    added to the file.

    This geometry information has been constructed by uniformly sampling the
    pixels that comprise each image. Pixels have been sampled on an 8x8 grid,
    i.e., every 64th pixel. To accommodate pointing uncertainty, the image
    boundary was expanded on every side by a distance equivalent to 25
    narrow-angle pixels.

    For each sampled pixel, a variety of geometric quantitities have been
    calculated, and the minimum and maximum values of each quantity have been
    tabulated. Note that, for angular quantities that cycle from 360 degrees
    to zero, the tabulated minimum can be numerically greater than the
    maximum. If the ring plane does not fall within the field of view, values
    of the NULL_CONSTANT appear in the table.

    Generally, regions of the ring plane that are obscured by Saturn or by a
    targeted moon are excluded from the tabulation. However, the last ten
    columns of the table contain quantities that are independent of the field
    of view. These quantities are tabulated as single values rather than as
    minimum/maximum pairs."
