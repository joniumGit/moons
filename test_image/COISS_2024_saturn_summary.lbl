  DESCRIPTION                   = "This index describes the Saturn intercept
    geometry of the field of view of Cassini ISS images. The table contains
    one row for each image file found on the volume identified by the
    VOLUME_ID keyword above.

    Occasionally, SPICE pointing information is unavailable for the time at
    which an image was exposed. When this situation occurs, no row has been
    added to the file.

    Most of this geometry information has been constructed by uniformly
    sampling the pixels that comprise each image. Pixels have been sampled on
    an 8x8 grid, i.e., every 64th pixel. To accommodate pointing uncertainty,
    the image boundary was expanded on every side by a distance equivalent to
    25 narrow-angle pixels.

    For each sampled pixel, a variety of geometric quantitities have been
    calculated, and the minimum and maximum values of each quantity have been
    tabulated. Note that, for angular quantities that cycle from 360 degrees
    to zero, the tabulated minimum can be numerically greater than the
    maximum. If Saturn does not fall within the field of view, values of the
    NULL_CONSTANT appear in the table.

    Regions of Saturn that are obscured by a targeted moon or by the main
    rings are excluded from the tabulation. The dark side of the planet is
    also generally excluded.

    Note that the last nine columns of the table contain quantities that are
    independent of the field of view. These quantities are tabulated as single
    values rather than as minimum/maximum pairs."
