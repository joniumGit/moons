# VicarUtil module

## This module provides utilities for reading Vicar Image files.

This has been tested on data from the Cassini probe, but not from anything else. It has been written with all types of
Vicar Image files in mind, but it has not been tested.

#### Functionality

This actually has some functionality build in too, check ``vicarutil label-reader`` for a json printer for labels.

### This desperately needs unit tests.
